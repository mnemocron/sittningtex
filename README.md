# SittningTeX
(originally: SitsiTex)
## What is SittningTeX?
Tired of reinventing the wheel many times over, I started developing this for my personal use in order to easily generate good-looking songbooks for Sittnings. Later, I then decided I would share it with other songmasters in order to simplify the process and make the result more elegant using the power of LaTeX. This comes with the added benefit of being able to share a common song library for all users, further spreading the love for one of our favorite activities.

## Songlist
All the songs are saved in `songs.dat` which uses the old format.

## This Fork
This repo is a fork from my good friend [DavidResin/sitsitex](https://github.com/DavidResin/sitsitex).
The original repo has not had pushes in a long time and this fork is just for me to get started and have a project that compiles in TexStudio.

## Packages needed
SitsiTeX relies on a specific package, [`songs.sty`](http://songs.sourceforge.net/), for most of the formatting. Please use the installed version.
